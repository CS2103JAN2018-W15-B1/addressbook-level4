== Introduction

Employees Tracker (E.T.) is a *Human Resource Manager* application for managers who *prefer to use a desktop app for managing his/her subordinates*. More importantly, E.T. is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, E.T. can get your employees management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.
