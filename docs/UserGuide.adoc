=== The User Interface

==== Knowing the components

_Figure 2_ shows the 5 major components of the user interface of Employees Tracker (ET):

* Command Box:where you type in commands
* Result Display Box: where ET shows text result to you
* Employees List Panel: where the list of all employees is shown
* Employee's Profile Panel: where the details of the selected employee is shown
* Notification cards: where ET reminds you about ended events

.User Interface
image::UiLabelled.jpg[width="790"]

==== Reading the result display box

The result display box shows 3 types of information:

* Error messages in [red]#red#, if the command you entered does not exists or does not match the pre-defined format.
* Hints about the format and usage of the command in [green]#green#.
* Statuses of the Employee Tracker in [white]#white#, if your command is processed successfully.

[NOTE]
ET will intelligently provide [green]#hints# according to the words you type in the `Command Box`.

==== Understanding the notification system

====== Notification cards

_Figure 3_ shows a notification card of ET. Each notification card contains 4 information, which are index, event name, name of person in-charge and expiry date and time.

.A notification card
image::card_labelled.jpg[width=""]

===== Two Phase notification

ET has a 2 phase notification system, i.e. there will be 2 notification cards popping up to remind you of each event.

* The first phase notification will pop out in a [blue]#blue# notification card, on the day of expiry, as shown in _Figure 4_.
* The second phase notification will pop out in a [red]#red# notification card, at the exact time of expiry, as shown in _Figure 5_.

.First phase notification card
image::card_blue.png[width=""]

.Second phase notification card
image::card_red.png[width=""]

For example, suppose you have assigned a task to Alex which will due on 27th May 2018 4:00 pm. When you open ET for the first time in the morning of 27th May 2018, you will be notified that Alex has a task that will due on *today* in a [blue]#blue# notification card. Later at 4:00 pm of 27th May 2018, you will receive the second phase notification in [red]#red#, informing you that Alex should have finished the task by *now* .

===== Notification card in Operating System

We understand that you as a manager lead a busy life, so we don't expect you to stare at ET at all times to catch the notification cards. Instead, ET is capable of showing notification cards in your computer's system (e.g. Windows, Mac, Linux, etc.) while you are using other software, as shown in _Figure 6_. Thus, you can feel free to minimize ET and continue working on your computer.

.ET shows notification card about event expiry even if you are using other programs.
image::card_windows.png[width=""]

[NOTE]
This feature may not work on some computer systems.

===== The Notification Center

To prevent notification cards from flooding the screen, notification cards in Employees Tracker (ET) will be hidden after 5 seconds.

However, fret not, you can still find them in the notification center. To open the `Notification Center`, please refer to <<Toggling the notification center : `noti`>>, or *double press* kbd:[SHIFT]. After that, you will be greeted by the `Notification Center` as shown in _Figure 7_. In the `Notification Center`, you will see a list of all un-dismissed notification cards.
