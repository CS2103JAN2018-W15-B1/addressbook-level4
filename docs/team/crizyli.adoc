== PROJECT: Employees Tracker

---

== Overview

Employees Tracker (E.T.) is a *Human Resource Manager* application that helps managers to manage their subordinates. Its
has 2 main functionalities: providing information about employees, as well as helping in tracking the tasks assigned to
each employee.

Its User Interface (UI) is a hybrid of Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User
Interface (GUI). That said, ET will suit you better if you can type fast and are familiar with CLI.
